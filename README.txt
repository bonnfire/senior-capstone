The Capstone folder contains the work that my team of three Amherst College senior statistics majors, including myself, completed for the senior seminar course, namely Statistics 495. 

The capstone project serves as the grounds for a comprehensive evaluation of each student's achievement in the major. Through my team's project, we explored the process of conducting network analysis as a tool for exploratory data analysis in R. We demonstrated our understanding of network analysis through the application of six clustering algorithms on a wine reviews dataset. 

Below are descriptions associated with the files:
